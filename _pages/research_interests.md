I used to do research relevant to comparative education, higher education policy, and critical thinking. But now I am more interested in the human development and family science.

My research interests mainly focus on parenting (Chinese parenting practices, co-parenting), children's social-emotional development in the context of family, family relations (especially father-child relation), and critical thinking.

I took some psychology courses both in UG studie and PG studies:
* **General Psychology** (UG Course, ZYK0220002)
* **Educational Psychology** (UG Course, ZYK0220005)
* **Psychology and Education of Children with Learning Disabilities** (UG Course, ZYK0220036)
* **The Psychology of Parenting** (PG Course, PEDU6705)
* **Motivating the Academically Unmotivated** (PG Course, PEDU6506)
* **Introducion to Counselling Theory** (PG Course, PEDU6512)
* **Family-School-Community Collaboration: From Theory and Research to Practice** (PG Course, PEDU6704)
* **Contemporary Issues in Students' Personal and Social Development** (PG Course, PEDU6502)
* **Educating Students with Special Needs** (PG Course, PEDU6516)
