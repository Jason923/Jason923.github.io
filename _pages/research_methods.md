Qualitative methods have been used in my previous projects and research. My ongoing project "Siblings with a Large Age Gap: The Issue of Parenting" uses a mixed methods approach, mainly qualitaive, with some quantitative components.

For research methods courses, I took the following courses:
* **Educational Research Methodology** (UG Course)
* **Educational Statistics and Data Analysis** (UG Course)
* **Quantitative Data Management and Analysis in Educational Research** (PG Course)
* **Multi-dimensional and Multicausal Analysis in Educational Research** (PG Course, taught by Professor Kit Tai Hau)

Apart from those courses, I also participated in the workshop [Statistical Methods for Research Students] organized by the Department of Statistics at the Chinese University of Hong Kong. This workshop contained some quantitative research knowledge and skills; please see the following.
* **Linear Regression on SPSS**
* **Introduction to ANOVA via SPSS**
* **Factor Analysis and Structural Equation Modeling**
* **Introduction to Neural Networks via SPSS**
* **Survival Analysis**
