I'm super proud to introduce some of my works in the domain of critical thinking, the most influential one is --「Critical Thinking Learners Alliance」 WeChat Account, which was founded by me on May 24, 2021. We aim to disseminate content on critical thinking. This will include the latest research findings on critical thinking, the utilization of critical thinking in conjunction with other disciplines in basic education, the practice of critical thinking in higher education, the analysis of social issues with a critical lens, and the integration of critical thinking in career and academic planning.

And I'm so thrilled to announce that, so far, we have published 64 articles, gained more than 2,000 followers, and the total readership of the tweets is more than 30,000!

Besides, I am also the Executive Editor and Technical Editor of the e-journal Critical and Creative Thinking Newsletter. We have published 74 issues and released over 500 papers since 2011, making us the earliest and the only critical thinking e-journal in China, and we have had a great impact across the country.
