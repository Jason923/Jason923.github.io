Hi there! Welcome to my personal website. My name is Junxuan (Jason) LI, I am currently a full-time research assistant at the [Department of Psychology](https://www.eduhk.hk/ps/en/), [The Education University of Hong Kong](https://www.eduhk.hk/en/), as well as a part-time research assistant at the [Relationships and Emotions in Adolescent Life (REALife) Lab](https://www.realifelab.com/), at the [Department of Educational Psychology](https://www.fed.cuhk.edu.hk/eps/), [The Chinese University of Hong Kong](https://www.cuhk.edu.hk/english/)

My research interests lie in developmental psychology and human development & family science. Specifically, I am particularly interested in parenting, child & adolescent social emotional development, mental health. Specifically, I am particularly interested in how environmental factors, such as family dynamics, culture, socialization practices, may shape their development and mental health.

When I'm not working or studying, I enjoy listening to music, playing games, watching TV, and spending time with my girlfriend Haoying (she's a master's student specializing in Early Childhood Education). I am originally from [Qujing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qujing), [Yunnan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yunnan) (a place of stunning beauty), China, fluent in Mandarin and English.
