I'm super proud to introduce some of my works in the domain of critical thinking, the most influential one is --「Critical Thinking Learners Alliance」 WeChat Account, which was founded by me on May 24, 2021. We aim to disseminate content on critical thinking. This will include the latest research findings on critical thinking, the utilization of critical thinking in conjunction with other disciplines in basic education, the practice of critical thinking in higher education, the analysis of social issues with a critical lens, and the integration of critical thinking in career and academic planning. In addition, we collaborated with researchers in North America and China to conduct a variety of salon activities, such as book sharing, seminars, and Q&A sessions.

And I'm so thrilled to announce that, so far, we have published 64 articles, gained more than 2,000 followers, and the total readership of the tweets is more than 30,000!
