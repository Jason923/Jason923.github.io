I conducted research with both quantitative methods (mainly) and qualitative methods. My ongoing project, "Siblings with a Large Age Gap: The Issue of Parenting" uses a mixed methods approach, including both qualitative (semi-structured interview and thematic analysis) and quantitative components (survey).

For quantitative methods, I can use SPSS (proficient), Mplus (proficient), R (not so proficient, still learning), and Stata (not so proficient, still learning) to conduct basic data analysis (e.g., correlation, regression, t-test, ANOVA, etc.) and advanced statistical modeling (e.g., multivariate analysis, structural equation modeling, etc.). Currently, I'm learning how to conduct longitudinal data analysis (e.g., cross-lagged panel model, etc.) and Bayesian SEM.

For qualitative methods, I am proficient in using NVivo. I can conduct interviews, observations, thematic analysis, and grounded theory.

I completed a series of research methods courses:
* **Educational Research Methodology** (UG Course)
* **Educational Statistics and Data Analysis** (UG Course)
* **Quantitative Data Management and Analysis in Educational Research** (PG Course)
* **Multi-dimensional and Multicausal Analysis in Educational Research** (PG Course, taught by Professor Kit-Tai Hau)

Apart from those courses, I also participated in the workshop [Statistical Methods for Research Students] organized by the Department of Statistics at the Chinese University of Hong Kong. This workshop contained a range of quantitative research knowledge and skills. Please see the following.
* **Linear Regression on SPSS**
* **Introduction to ANOVA via SPSS**
* **Factor Analysis and Structural Equation Modeling**
* **Introduction to Neural Networks via SPSS**
* **Survival Analysis**

Besides, I also took some online research methods courses:
* **Qualitative Research Methods in Psychology** (Coursera, offered by APA)
* **Methods for Quantitative Research in Psychology** (Coursera, offered by APA)
* **Statistics in Psychological Research** (Coursera, offered by APA)
* **Structural Equation Model and its Applications** (Coursera, offered by CUHK)
* **Mplus: From Beginner to Proficient** (Offered by BIG DATA TECHNOLOGY CO., LTD.)
