About Me
======
Hello and welcome to my website. My name is Junxuan (Jason), LI, I am currently a Master's student at the [Department of Educational Psychology](https://www.fed.cuhk.edu.hk/eps/index.html), [The Chinese Universtiy of Hong Kong](https://www.cuhk.edu.hk/english/index.html). I am particularly interested in parenting in two-child families, especially those who have siblings with a large age gap and the father's involvement in children's social emotional development.
Besides parenting, I am also interested in the development of critical thinking in the context of family. Particularly, how parents can develop critical thinking sub-skills in their children at an early age.

When I'm not working or studying, I enjoy listening to music, watching TV, and spending time with my girlfriend. I am originally from Yunnan, China, fluent in Mandarin and English.
