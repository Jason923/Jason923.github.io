I used to do research relevant to comparative education, higher education policy, and critical thinking. But now, my interests have turned to the domain of developmental psychology, human development and family science.

My research interests mainly focus on parenting in two-child families who have siblings with a large age gap (Chinese parenting practices, co-parenting), children's social-emotional development in the context of family (siblings' and father's involvement), family relations (parent-child relation, siblings relation), parentification, and critical thinking.

I took some psychology courses both in UG and PG studies that made me interested in psychology:
* **General Psychology** (UG Course, ZYK0220002)
* **Educational Psychology** (UG Course, ZYK0220005)
* **Mental Health Education** (UG Course, TSB0111007)
* **Principles of Moral Education** （UG Course, ZYK0220010）
* **Psychology and Education of Children with Learning Disabilities** (UG Course, ZYK0220036)
* **The Psychology of Parenting** (PG Course, PEDU6705)
* **Motivating the Academically Unmotivated** (PG Course, PEDU6506)
* **Introducion to Counselling Theory** (PG Course, PEDU6512)
* **Family-School-Community Collaboration: From Theory and Research to Practice** (PG Course, PEDU6704)
* **Contemporary Issues in Students' Personal and Social Development** (PG Course, PEDU6502)
* **Educating Students with Special Needs** (PG Course, PEDU6516)

I also took some online courses that related to psychology:
* **Introduction to Psychology** (Coursera, offered by Yale University)
* **Understanding Child Development: From Synapse to Society** (Coursera, offered by Utrecht University)
