Hi there! My name is Junxuan (Jason) LI, I am currently a Master's student at the [Department of Educational Psychology](https://www.fed.cuhk.edu.hk/eps/index.html), [The Chinese Universtiy of Hong Kong](https://www.cuhk.edu.hk/english/index.html). 

My research interests lie in the human development and family science. Specifically, I am particularly interested in parenting (especially two-child families who have siblings with a large age gap), children's social-emotional development, family relations, and parentification.
Besides the above, I am also interested in the development of critical thinking in the context of family. Particularly, how parents can develop critical thinking sub-skills in their children at an early age. For details please see [here](https://jason923.github.io/Research%20Interests/).

When I'm not working or studying, I enjoy listening to music (I love all kinds of music), playing League of Legends (a MOBA game), watching TV, and spending time with my girlfriend Haoying (she's a master's student specializing in Early Childhood Education). I am originally from [Qujing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qujing), [Yunnan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yunnan) (a place of stunning beauty), China, fluent in Mandarin and English.
