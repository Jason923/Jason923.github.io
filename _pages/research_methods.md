Qualitative methods have been used in my previous projects and research. My ongoing project "Siblings with a Large Age Gap: The Issue of Parenting" uses a mixed methods approach, mainly qualitaive, with some quantitative components.

For research methods courses, I took the following courses:
* **Educational Research Methodology** (UG Course)
* **Educational Statistics and Data Analysis** (UG Course)
* **Quantitative Data Management and Analysis in Educational Research** (PG Course)
* **Multi-dimensional and Multicausal Analysis in Educational Research** (PG Course, taught by Professor Kit Tai Hau)
