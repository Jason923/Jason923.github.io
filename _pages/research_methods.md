I conducted research with both quantitative methods (mainly) and qualitative methods. My last project, "Siblings with a Large Age Gap: The Issue of Parenting" uses a mixed methods approach, including both qualitative (semi-structured interview and thematic analysis) and quantitative components (survey). Now, I work with Prof.Kevin Ka Shing Chan at the Department of Psychology, The Education University of Hong Kong. We are preparing an exciting project about designing a mindfulness-enhanced behavioral parent training program for families with autistic children. We combine knowledge from behavioral science, mindfulness research, and health economics in one study to assess the clinical effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of this intervention program. Besides, I also work with Prof. Skyler Hawk at the Relationships and Emotions in Adolescent Life Lab. We are conducting an very interesting and groudbreaking project related to students' engagement and ethical reasoning of AI use in schoolwork. We collaborate with Prof. Judith Smetana, Dr. Natalie Wong, and other researchers in a global scope. 

For quantitative methods, I can use SPSS (proficient), Mplus (proficient), R (intermediate), and Stata (intermediate) to conduct basic data analysis (e.g., descriptive correlation, t-test, ANOVA, etc.), intermediate analyses (e.g., general linear model, multiple regression, CFA, mediation and moderation models), and advanced statistical modeling (e.g., path analysis, structural equation modeling, latent growth model, latent profile analysis, latent transition analysis, cross-lagged panel model, etc.). Currently, I'm learning how to conduct other advanced statistical models (e.g., Bayesian SEM, dynamic SEM). Besides, I am also capable of some physiological data analysis (e.g., ECG data).

For qualitative methods, I am proficient in using NVivo. I can conduct interviews, observations, thematic analysis, and typological analysis.

I completed a series of research methods courses:
* **Educational Research Methodology** (UG Course)
* **Educational Statistics and Data Analysis** (UG Course)
* **Quantitative Data Management and Analysis in Educational Research** (PG Course)
* **Multi-dimensional and Multicausal Analysis in Educational Research** (PG Course, taught by Professor Kit-Tai Hau)

Apart from those courses, I also participated in the workshop [Statistical Methods for Research Students] organized by the Department of Statistics at the Chinese University of Hong Kong. This workshop contained a range of quantitative research knowledge and skills. Please see the following.
* **Linear Regression on SPSS**
* **Introduction to ANOVA via SPSS**
* **Factor Analysis and Structural Equation Modeling**
* **Introduction to Neural Networks via SPSS**
* **Survival Analysis**

Besides, I also took some online research methods courses:
* **Qualitative Research Methods in Psychology** (Coursera, offered by APA)
* **Methods for Quantitative Research in Psychology** (Coursera, offered by APA)
* **Statistics in Psychological Research** (Coursera, offered by APA)
* **Structural Equation Model and its Applications** (Coursera, offered by CUHK)
* **Mplus: From Beginner to Proficient** (Offered by BIG DATA TECHNOLOGY CO., LTD.)
