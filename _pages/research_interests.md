I used to do research relevant to comparative education, higher education policy, and critical thinking. But now I am more interested in the human development and family science.

My research interests mainly focus on parenting (Chinese parenting practices, co-parenting), children's social-emotional development in the context of family, family relations (especially father-child relation), and critical thinking.
